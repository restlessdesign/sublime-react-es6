# sublime-react for ES6

Snippets and syntax highlighting for React.js / JSX / ES6.

This is a ES6-compatible version of [sublime-react](https://github.com/reactjs/sublime-react), designed for those who make use of the new ES6 class syntax (and donâ€™t want trailing commas in their snippets.)

To use this version, add this repository to the Package Manager and install `sublime-react` again (be sure that you select the correct repo!)
